# Leads Database Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced ScrapedIn to save scraped LinkedIn leads to both Google Sheets (existing functionality) and Supabase database with a modern web interface for viewing and managing leads.

## 🆕 New Features Implemented

### 1. Database Enhancement
- **Enhanced Database Service** (`services/databaseService.js`)
  - Added `getJobsWithPagination()` method for paginated lead retrieval
  - Added `getJobStats()` method for dashboard statistics
  - Supports advanced filtering by status, company, title, location, and date ranges

### 2. API Endpoint
- **New API Route** (`/api/leads`)
  - GET endpoint supporting pagination and filtering
  - Query parameters: `page`, `limit`, `status`, `company`, `title`, `location`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`
  - Returns leads data with pagination metadata and statistics

### 3. Leads Database Web Interface
- **New Page** (`leads.html`)
  - Modern responsive design matching ScrapedIn's existing UI
  - Statistics dashboard showing total, pending, and processed leads
  - Advanced filtering interface with real-time search
  - Paginated table view with sortable columns
  - Mobile-responsive design

### 4. Navigation Integration
- **Updated Navigation** across all pages
  - Added "📊 Leads Database" link to all HTML files
  - Updated dashboard card to highlight the new leads functionality

### 5. Dual Database Storage
- **Enhanced Scraping Process** (`api/scrape-jobs.js`)
  - Now saves leads to BOTH Supabase and Google Sheets
  - Graceful error handling - continues if one storage method fails
  - Detailed response showing success counts for both databases

### 6. Security (RLS)
- **Row Level Security** already implemented in Supabase
  - Service role policies properly configured
  - Secure access patterns for all database operations

## 📊 Features

### Leads Database Page Features:
- **Statistics Cards**: Total leads, pending, and processed counts
- **Advanced Filtering**: 
  - Filter by status (pending, sent, failed)
  - Search by company name
  - Search by job title
  - Filter by location
  - Date range filtering
- **Pagination**: 20 leads per page with navigation controls
- **Responsive Table**:

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
Uses existing Supabase schema with `jobs` table:
- UUID primary keys

### Data Flow
1. **Scraping**: LinkedIn → Apify → ScrapedIn API

- Efficient pagination with offset/limit
- Optimized queries with selective filtering
- Client-side caching of statistics
