# UI-n8n Workflow Alignment Report

## Current Status: ✅ **ALIGNED**

The frontend UI is properly configured to work with the n8n LinkedIn Job Scraper workflow.

## Field Mapping Analysis

| UI Field | Data Sent | n8n Expected | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Job Title | `'Job Title': jobTitle` | `Job Title (textarea)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Location | `'Job Location': jobLocation` | `Job Location (textarea)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Company | `'Company Name': companyName` | `Company Name (text)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Published | `'Published at': publishedAt` | `Published at (dropdown)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Job Type | `'Job Type': jobType` | `Job Type (dropdown)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Work Type | `'On-site/Remote/Hybrid': workType` | `On-site/Remote/Hybrid (dropdown)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Experience | `'Experience Level': experienceLevel` | `Experience Level (dropdown)` | ✅ Perfect Match |
| Date Posted | `'Date posted': 10` (hardcoded) | `Date posted (number)` | ⚠️ See Note Below |

### Note on "Date Posted" Field
- The n8n workflow expects a `Date posted` field (number type, placeholder: "10")
- The UI doesn't have this field exposed to users
- **Fixed**: Script now sends hardcoded value of `10` (days) to satisfy n8n requirement
