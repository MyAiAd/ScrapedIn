Great question! Let me analyze what parts of your LinkedIn scraper are currently deployed as static files vs. what still requires server-side execution.

Based on my analysis, here's exactly what parts of your LinkedIn scraper are still running locally vs. what's deployed on Vercel:

## üö¶ **Current Deployment Status:**

### ‚úÖ **Working on Vercel (Static Site):**
- **Frontend HTML pages**: Dashboard, Scraper interface, Settings, Email Templates
- **Client-side JavaScript**: Form handling, UI interactions, data formatting
- **Static assets**: CSS, images, client-side scripts

### ‚ùå **Still Requires Local Server (`http://localhost:3000`):**

1. **Core API Endpoints** (from `server.js`):
   ```javascript
   /api/scrape-jobs          // Main scraping functionality
   /api/send-to-sheets       // Google Sheets integration
   /api/email/generate       // AI email generation
   /api/email/templates      // Email template management
   /api/email/test           // Email testing
   ```

2. **Server-side Services**:
   - Database operations (SQLite)
   - Email service (Nodemailer)
   - Google Sheets service
   - Apify API integration (server-side)
   - File system operations

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Google credentials
   - Email SMTP settings
   - API keys
   - Database paths

### üîß **Configuration Issue:**
Your `config.js` still points to:
```javascript
API_URL: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

## üéØ **What This Means:**

1. **Frontend works on Vercel** - Users can see your interface
2. **All functionality requires your local server** - Job scraping, email generation, etc. won't work unless you're running `node server.js` locally
3. **No data persistence** - Results are lost when your local server stops

## üöÄ **Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Quick Fix (Hybrid Setup)**
Keep running locally but update config for production:
```javascript
API_URL: window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ? 'http://localhost:3000' : 'https://your-production-api.com'
```

### **Option 2: Full Serverless (Recommended)**
Convert your Express routes to Vercel serverless functions. I can help you:
1. Move API endpoints to `/api` folder structure
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Update database to use a cloud solution

Would you like me to help you set up the serverless functions so everything runs on Vercel, or do you prefer to keep the local server for now?
