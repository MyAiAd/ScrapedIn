# Abort Button Feature - v2.1.1

## New Feature Added ✅

**Abort Workflow Button** - Users can now terminate the current workflow execution from the frontend UI.

## Visual Changes

### 1. **Button Layout**
- **Submit Button**: Now part of a flexible button row
- **Abort Button**: Red button that appears during workflow execution
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

### 2. **Abort Button Styling**
- **Color**: Red background (`bg-red-600`) with hover effects
- **Icon**: Stop icon (`fas fa-stop`)
- **Animation**: Pulsing red effect while workflow is running
- **Visibility**: Hidden by default, shows only during execution

## Functionality

### 1. **When Abort Button Appears**
- ✅ After clicking "Start Job Scraping"
- ✅ During status progression (all 8 steps)
- ✅ Remains visible until workflow completes or is aborted

### 2. **When Abort Button Hides**
- ✅ When workflow completes successfully
- ✅ When workflow encounters an error
- ✅ When user clicks abort
- ✅ On page load (initial state)

### 3. **Abort Action Behavior**
```javascript
✅ Clears all ongoing timeouts
✅ Stops status monitoring
✅ Resets workflow state
✅ Re-enables submit button
✅ Hides abort button
✅ Shows "Workflow aborted by user" message
✅ Displays "Ready for new search" after 1 second
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Workflow State Management**
```javascript
let isWorkflowRunning = false;     // Tracks if workflow is active
let currentWorkflowId = null;      // Current workflow identifier
let statusMonitoringTimeout = null; // Timeout reference for cancellation
```

### 2. **Abort Function**
- Clears any pending `setTimeout` calls
- Resets all workflow state variables
- Updates UI to ready state
- Provides user feedback

### 3. **Status Monitoring Integration**
- Each status step checks `isWorkflowRunning` before proceeding
- If workflow is aborted, monitoring stops immediately
- Prevents race conditions and memory leaks

## User Experience

### ✅ **Before (No Abort)**
- User starts workflow
- Must wait for completion or refresh page to stop
- No way to cancel ongoing process

### ✅ **After (With Abort)**
- User starts workflow
- Red "Abort Workflow" button appears with pulse animation
- User can click abort at any time
- Immediate feedback and clean state reset
- Can start new search immediately

## Button States

| State | Submit Button | Abort Button | Description |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Idle** | Enabled, blue | Hidden | Ready for new search |
| **Running** | Disabled, "Processing..." | Visible, pulsing red | Workflow executing |
| **Completed** | Enabled, blue | Hidden | Workflow finished |
| **Error** | Enabled, blue | Hidden | Error occurred |
| **Aborted** | Enabled, blue | Hidden | User cancelled |

## Testing the Feature

1. **Start a workflow** - Submit the form
2. **Verify abort button appears** - Should be visible and pulsing red
3. **Click abort button** - Should immediately stop workflow
4. **Check status messages** - Should show abort message
5. **Verify ready state** - Submit button should be re-enabled

## CSS Classes Added

```css
.abort-pulse          /* Pulsing red animation */
@keyframes pulse-red  /* Red pulse effect keyframes */
```

## Current Status

✅ **Abort button implemented** with full functionality  
✅ **State management** prevents race conditions  
✅ **Visual feedback** with pulsing animation  
✅ **Responsive design** works on all screen sizes  
✅ **Clean abort process** with proper cleanup  

Users now have full control over workflow execution!
